# StayConneted

**StayConnected** helps you stay organized and actively connected with your personal network using its relationship and meetup management systems. 

This app allows you to create a list of connections that you want to keep track of. It can provide insight on each connection, such as when you last met up. It also allows you to customize settings so that you're reminded when it's time to make plans for your next meetup. 

The app also facilitates creating meetups for your connections. You can schedule new meetups and send your connections text invites to notify them about those meetups. You can also view what meetups are coming up in your schedule and keep a history of past meetups that you've already initiated.

# Getting Started
First, to set up the back end of **StayConnected**, download or clone the backend/relationship-tracker-api repository and follow the **Getting Started** instructions in the README there. 

Then download or clone this frontend repository here.

From within the `relationships-tracker` directory, run a local server on localhost:3001 after you've already started your backend server on localhost:3000.
```
npm start
```

Open your browser to localhost:3001, and you're ready to start using the application!
